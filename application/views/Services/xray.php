            <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
            
            X-ray was discovered by Wilhelm Roentgen, a German scientist accidentally almost a century back.
            
             The images of X-rays at present the most crucial diagnostic instrument in the field of medicine. 
             They are used in the detection of bone injuries like dislocations and breaks and are also used in 
             the monitoring the recovery process of patients in case of such injuries. With the help of chest
              x-rays, physicians can examine your heart and lungs before confirming a diagnosis of lung cancer
               or collapsed lung, or pneumonia. Dentists too use them quite frequently. Ontario Diagnostic
                Centres(ODC) provide x-ray services in Markham, Etobicoke and Oakville.

            <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
            
            X-rays can easily penetrate through material comprised of light atoms, 
            such as flesh. They get absorbed by heavier atoms, such as metals.
             A beam of electrons of high energy crashes into a target metal which 
             results in the production of x-rays. A filter close to the source of the x-ray
              shields the rays of low energy. This makes way for the high energy rays to pass 
              through the body of a patient toward a film. A second sheet is incorporated to prevent 
              the separated x-rays from making the picture a bit obscured.
