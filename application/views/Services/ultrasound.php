            <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
            The advantages of ultrasound testing are manifold compared to other imaging categories. Some of these are as follows:
           </p>
           <ul>
                <li>
                    It’s much safer as it removes ionizing radiation from the process of testing.
                </li>
                <li>
                	Identifies lesions in females with thick breast tissue. This is usually difficult to recognize with the help of mammography.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                	An apparent image of soft tissue is produced which is normally hidden in x-ray images.
                </li>
            
                <li>
                	The images that are formed lead to additionally precise detection of lesion and groups which cannot be sufficiently interpreted via mammograms alone.
                </li>

                <li>
               	This method is non-invasive, painless and comfortable and doesn’t require any intravenous infusions or injections.
                </li>
                
                <li>
              	It’s cost-effective and greatly available.
                </li>
           </ul>

            Ontario Diagnostic Centres provides ultrasound services for the residents of Markham, Oakville and Etobicoke.
            Technicians of ultrasound are referred to as diagnostic medical sonographers or more popularly as sonographers. Due to the unique skills and duties of the job description of an ultrasound technician, The US Department of Labor views the job of an ultrasound technician to be apparent and totally separate to that of radiology jobs.
            Sonographers have a line of activities associated to propitiously finishing diagnostic ultrasound operations on patients.
 
            Ultrasound is safe and reliable. All Ontario Diagnostic Centre equipment is calibrated on a regular basis and maintained to the highest standard. Our technologists are highly trained and committed to continuing education. They were among the first certified for the 
            integrated prenatal screening program (IPS) which is a provincially funded program to detect abnormal pregnancy early.
